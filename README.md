# Credit Score Calculator

The code will prompt the user to enter various details related to their credit history. After all necessary fields are filled out, the program will calculate the user's credit score. Based on the score, the program will also determine your standing and how lenders will consider that score. As of right now, our program lacks a proper interface, which is something we would definitely like to add next.

In order to run the program, import or copy the code into an IDE that runs Python.
